# Bankist Project - Banking Application 
# JavaScript Project
## Desription of App Functionality, Features, and Methods

Javascript coding project I completed the Udemy - The Complete Javascript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert by Jonas Schmedtmann. After coding this banking application through the course I then added additional modifications to logic and added extensive commenting of code for educational purposes. I also added responsive layout CSS code for mobile devices (course project only provided for a desktop display).
